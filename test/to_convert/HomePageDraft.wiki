== Introduction ==

!GwtQuery a.k.a. gQuery is a jQuery-like API written in GWT, which allows GWT to be used in progressive enhancement scenarios where perhaps GWT widgets are too heavyweight. It can also be used to find and improve your GWT widgets.

!GwtQuery is easy to learn for those using jQuery as they share the same api, aditionally gquery adds nice features like type-safe css, compile time optimisations, etc.

Currently, almost the jQuery API is written and all CSS3 selectors should be supported. If you found anything unsupported or not implemented yet, please open an [http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery/issues/list issue].


== !GwtQuery in action ==
 * Enhance existing html by adding some nice effects using a syntax almost identical to jQuery:
{{{
import static com.google.gwt.query.client.GQuery.*;
import com.google.gwt.query.client.Function;

public void onModuleLoad() {
  //Hide the text and set the width and append an h1 element
  $("#text").hide()
    .css("width", "400px")
    .prepend("<h1>GwtQuery Rocks !</h1>");

    //add a click handler on the button
    $("button").click(new Function(){
      public void f() {
        //display the text with effects and animate its background color
        $("#text").as(Effects)
          .clipDown()
          .animate("backgroundColor: 'yellow'", 500)
          .delay(1000)
          .animate("backgroundColor: '#fff'", 1500);
      }
    });
}
}}}

 * Because gQuery is java, you can take advance of gquery type-safe methods and  let the compiler to warn you about incorrect syntax replacing the line above by:
{{{
   .css(CSS.WIDTH.with(Length.px(400)))
}}}
